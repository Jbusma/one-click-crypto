// Project: One Click Checkout Crypto
// Purpose: Simplify crypto payments using Account Abstraction (EIP-4337)

ARCHITECTURE:
- Smart contracts handle only essential on-chain logic (Account implementation)
- ProxyFactory contract handles permissionless account creation via EIP-1167 proxies
- Gas costs for proxy deployment sponsored through paymaster
- Keep gas costs minimal for both users and us

COMPONENTS:
1. Account.sol - EIP-4337 compatible smart contract wallet
   - Handles user operations
   - Manages shipping info
   - Integrates with EntryPoint

2. OneClickToken.sol - ERC20 token for payments
   - Simple implementation
   - Used for payment flows

3. OneClickPaymaster.sol - Handles gas sponsorship
   - Supports multiple tokens
   - Exchange rate management

4. ProxyFactory.sol - Handles account creation
   - Deploys minimal proxies (EIP-1167)
   - Permissionless deployment
   - Gas sponsored through paymaster

DEPLOYMENT FLOW:
1. Deploy EntryPoint (or use existing)
2. Deploy Account implementation
3. Deploy OneClickToken
4. Deploy OneClickPaymaster
5. Deploy ProxyFactory

PRINCIPLES:
- All solidity code needs to be audited as it is added to the codebase
- Optimize for gas efficiency

DEVELOPMENT:
- Always make sure to use the latest best practices, no deprecated ethers.js calls
- Keep tests isolated but efficient
- Every case should have a unit test and integration test
